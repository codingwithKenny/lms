        </h1>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
          <strong>Muslim Groups of School</strong> was founded in  
          <span className="text-red-500 font-bold"> 1986</span> by the visionary group  
          <span className="text-purple-600 font-bold"> YOUMBAS ANJAENA</span>. With a mission to provide  
          high-quality education rooted in Islamic values, the school started with the establishment of  
          <strong> Muslim Nursery and Primary School</strong>, offering a strong foundation in academics  
          and moral teachings.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
          As the institution grew, <strong>Muslim Comprehensive College</strong> was later established,  
          further expanding our commitment to excellence in secondary education. Over the years,  
          we have nurtured and graduated countless students who have excelled in various fields of life.

          Today, <strong>Muslim Group of Schools</strong> remains dedicated to shaping future leaders  
          through a balanced blend of academic excellence, character building, and Islamic  
          principles. Our students continue to make us proud as they thrive in their  
          communities and beyond.
